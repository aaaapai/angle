Description:
volk is a meta-loader for Vulkan. It allows you to dynamically load
entrypoints required to use Vulkan without linking to vulkan-1.dll
or statically linking Vulkan loader. Additionally, volk simplifies
the use of Vulkan extensions by automatically loading all associated
entrypoints. Finally, volk enables loading Vulkan entrypoints directly
from the driver which can increase performance by skipping loader
dispatch overhead.
